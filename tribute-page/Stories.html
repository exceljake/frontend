        <h1 class="title ">Bruce Willis</h1>

        <h1 id="h1-stor">He Reportedly Clashed With Some Of His Celebrity Colleagues
        </h1>

        <p id="p-stor"> Willis famously feuded with Moonlighting co-star Cybill Shepherd and several film directors. His early days as an actor seemed to be more agreeable, but as Willis became recognizable, he reportedly became somewhat high-maintenance. </p>

        <p id="p-stor">According to a 1986 Newsweek article, Willis once asked Shepherd (regarding their Moonlighting characters David and Maddie), "When is David going to get to slap Maddie? You think America is ready to watch us slug it out on prime-time television?
            " He clashed with Cop Out director Kevin Smith, who wrote about it in his biography Tough Sh*t: There were no staff limbo parties like there'd been at the Blue Moon Detective Agency whenever Bruce was around. </p>

        <p id="p-stor">The singing pitchman who made me believe that Seagram’s Wine Coolers were a manly enough spirit to chug at a high school kegger? He turned out to be the unhappiest, most bitter, and meanest emo-b*tch I've ever met at any job I've held down. And
            mind you, I've worked at Domino's Pizza.</p>

        <p id="p-stor">Willis bumped heads with Michael Bay when he was pitched to direct a Die Hard movie. Tears of the Sun director Fuqua had an especially difficult time with Willis - the actor suffered an injury from a projectile that simulated ammunition and ended
            up suing over the incident. </p>

        <h1 id="h1-stor">He Purchased Most Of An Idaho Town</h1>

        <p id="p-stor">Willis started investing in Idaho real estate in 1988 after acquiring property in Malibu, CA. Over the following decades, he began to buy up large sections of Hailey, ID, and the surrounding area south of Sun Valley. </p>

        <p id="p-stor">His investment projects in the town included the creation of office spaces, a restaurant, nightclub, and a movie theater. He added Soldier Mountain, a ski resort, to his real estate portfolio in 1996. He then donated it to a local non-profit in
            2012. Willis has alsochampioned environmental issues in Idaho, such as addressing nuclear waste in the Snake River Plain Aquifer. </p>

        <h1 id="h1-stor">He Helped Open Planet Hollywood</h1>

        <p id="p-stor">In 1991, Willis teamed up with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and then-wife Demi Moore to help launch a franchise of themed restaurants called Planet Hollywood. Willis personally invested in the restaurants and was a brand ambassador
            for the franchise. </p>

        <p id="p-stor">The concept came from former CEO of Hard Rock Café Robert Earl, and the four mega-stars used their celebrity status to help market the restaurant chain. However, as time passed and careers faltered, the Planet Hollywood brand reportedly suffered.
            According to CNN, economic hardships caused the company to file for bankruptcy twice in the following years. </p>
